    About port numbers: the below will try to use port 8888, if it is not available, it will use
    the next port available.
    This configuration is useful during development to be able to start multiple Lily nodes
    on one host, without port conflicts, and without resorting to arbitrary ephemeral port numbers.
    To use a fixed port, remove the suggestedPort attribute and set the port to the desired value.
